PROJECT TITLE: 
Spending Tracker

PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
As someone who buy things simultaneously and impulsively, I created a java program that tracks what I bought and how much it costs.
The code will then show everything the user bought in a "receipt" format.

PROGRAM FEATURES:
- Lists items that the user inputs
- Lists the prices of said items
- Calculates the the balance of the <user>, as (user) enters each item
- Displays how much money the <user> have after buying everything the <user> needed.
- The program displays every item and its prices in a receipt format after the <user> types "done"

HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
- <user> inputs their budget/allowance
- Enter the items name
- Enter the prices of the items
- Type "done" after everything has been bought
- View the results
